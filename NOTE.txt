This project was created by me to ease my work for find files and deleting them.
I wanted to implement more things such as port scanning, site grabbing, file transfers, downloads, etc.
I would appreciate if you can contribute to this small project with your ideas, algorithms and code.
Thak you.


NOTE:

The main file is PySystem.py so make it an executable and run it.
